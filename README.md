I am a software engineer with endless curiosity for bringing creativity to the art of problem-solving. My background as a former career airline pilot and flight instructor fostered a rigorous appetite for all sorts of things that move, and the ways in which they work. I am no stranger to utilizing care and presence in the pursuit of a job well done, whether that be through solving complex & time-sensitive problems in a fast paced crew environment, to building bicycles for friends.
